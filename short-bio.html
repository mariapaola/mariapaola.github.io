<H2>Short bio</H2>
Maria Paola Bonacina received a Laurea and a Doctorate from the Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Milano, and a PhD from the State University of New York at Stony Brook, all three in Computer Science. After postdoc's at Argonne National Laboratory and INRIA Lorraine, she was first Assistant Professor and then Associate Professor at the University of Iowa, where she received NSF RIA and CAREER Awards and a Dean Scholar Award. Maria Paola is Professor of Computer Science at the Universit&agrave; degli Studi di Verona, where her research was supported by Italian and EU agencies, and lately by an Amazon Research Award. Her research area is automated reasoning, a super-exciting field at the intersection of artificial intelligence, computational logic, and symbolic computation.
<p>
Maria Paola visits regularly the Computer Science Laboratory of SRI International, where she spent two sabbatical years. She was Visiting Professor at TU Dresden and the University of Manchester, Visiting Research Scholar at Microsoft Research Redmond, the Isaac Newton Institute (University of Cambridge), and the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing (University of California at Berkeley). She visited many research centers, including LORIA Nancy, Universit&auml;t Koblenz-Landau, MPI Saarbr&uuml;cken, Tel Aviv University, King's College, EPFL, ETHZ, Chalmers University of Technology, Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble, TU Graz, and Universit&eacute; Paris XI Orsay, in Europe; Yale University, Nuance Communications, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, University of New Mexico, University of Oregon, Argonne National Laboratory, Stanford University, Iowa State University, University of Colorado at Denver, University of Idaho, CUNY Graduate Center, and Portland State University, in America; Chinese Academy of Sciences, East China Normal University, Tsinghua University, and National Taiwan University, in Asia.
<p>
Maria Paola was invited speaker at several events including FMCAD (Formal Methods for Computer-Aided Design), PxTP (Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving), FroCoS (Frontiers of Combining Systems), PCR (Parallel Constraint Reasoning), TABLEAUX (Automated Reasoning by Analytic Tableaux and Related Methods), PPDP (Principles and Practice of Declarative Programming), and STRATEGIES (Strategies in Automated Deduction). She serves regularly on the Program Committee of IJCAR (International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning), CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction) for which she was also program chair, and several other conferences. She was elected thrice to the Board of Trustees of CADE, and twice President of the Board: in this capacity, she chaired the committee that assigns the Herbrand Award, and she instituted the CADE Best Paper and the Skolem (test of time) awards. She chaired once the Skolem Award Committee, and she organized two automated deduction seminars at Schloss Dagstuhl.
