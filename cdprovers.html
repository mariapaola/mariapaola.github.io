<H2>The Clause-Diffusion theorem provers</H2>

<A HREF="https://mariapaola.github.io/distributed.html">
Clause-Diffusion</A> is a general methodology for distributed deduction by
<em>distributed search</em>:
the search space of the theorem proving problem
is subdivided among concurrent <em>asynchronous</em> deductive processes,
each generating a derivation and keeping a database of clauses.
A distributed derivation is given by the collection of these derivations,
and it succeeds as soon as one of them does.
A Clause-Diffusion strategy is defined by an <em>inference system</em> and a
<em>parallel search plan</em>, executed by each process.
The parallel search plan controls
the selection of inferences, like in sequential search,
their <em>subdivision</em>, with a choice of <em>subdivision criteria</em>,
and the <em>diffusion</em> of clauses by broadcasting.
There is no need for a master or top-level scheduler to distribute the work:
the subdivision of inferences is achieved dynamically by the processes,
by subdividing the clauses, hence the inferences.
The following Clause-Diffusion provers were developed:
<ul>
<li><b>Aquarius (January 1992 - December 1992)</b>
was developed for workstation networks (each deductive process runs on a 
workstation) at <A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/">SUNY Stony Brook</A>
in the spring and summer of 1992, as part of
<A HREF="https://mariapaola.github.io/pub_theses.html">my Phd thesis</A>,
and experimentation continued till the end of that year.
Aquarius was the Clause-Diffusion parallelization of
<A HREF="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/otter/">Otter</A> (version 2.2).
The logic is first-order logic with equality, and the code is written in C,
using the high-level language PCN for parallelism and communication:

<li><b>Peers (January 1993 - May 1995)</b> was developed for workstation networks at the
<A HREF="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/">Argonne National Laboratory</A>
in January-February 1993.
Peers is a Clause-Diffusion prover for equational theories, possibly modulo
associativity and commutativity. It was written in C using
<A HREF="http://www.netlib.org/p4/index.html">p4</A> for message-passing,
and incorporating code from the <em>Otter Parts Store</em> (version of December 1992).
Its name emphasizes that all processes in Clause-Diffusion are peers,
with no master-slave relation.
Peers and its experiments up to March 1994 were presented in:

<li><b>Peers-mcd</b> was the successor of Peers, implementing
Modified Clause-Diffusion rather than Clause-Diffusion. Four versions were developed:

<ul>
<li><b>Peers-mcd.a (June 1995 - September 1996)</b> was written in June 1995.

<li><b>Peers-mcd.b (October 1996 - January 1999):</b>
work on Peers-mcd restarted in June 1996, and in October 1996
a completely new Peers-mcd theorem prover (Peers-mcd.b)
was built on top of the Argonne prover
<A HREF="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/eqp/">EQP</A> (version 0.9), that had just proved that 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.unm.edu/~mccune/papers/robbins/">Robbins algebras are Boolean</A>.
Peers-mcd was written in C using
<A HREF="http://www.netlib.org/mpi/index.html">MPI</A> for message-passing,
and was ported on both workstation networks and multiprocessors.
In addition to a different implementation,
Peers-mcd differed from its predecessors because it featured a new family
of criteria for subdivision of clauses, the <em>Ancestor-Graph Oriented criteria</em>,
or <em>AGO criteria</em> for short.
The theorem prover, the AGO criteria, and the experimental results up to
the summer of 1997, including <em>instances of super-linear speed-up</em>
on two lemmas that represent two thirds of the proof of the Robbins problem, are described in:

The Robbins experiments were repeated,

in the third. These experiments are described in:

<li><b>Peers-mcd.d (April 2000 - July 2001)</b> was developed
in the spring and summer of 2000,
making available in the framework of Modified Clause-Diffusion
both distributed search and <em>multi-search</em>,
that differentiates the searches generated by the parallel processes
by assigning them different search plans.
Peers-mcd.d can work in three modes:
<ul>
<li><em>Pure distributed-search mode:</em>
search space subdivided among the processes - all processes execute the same search plan.
<li><em>Pure multi-search mode:</em>
search space not subdivided - every process executes a different search plan.
<li><em>Hybrid mode:</em>
search space subdivided - the processes execute different search plans.
</ul>
For each mode, the prover implements various strategies described in
